# Computer Networks Notes

### Define Networks

* A network consists of two or more computers that are linked in order to share the resources (such as printers and CD's), exchange files or allow electronic communications. The computer on a network may be linked through cables, telephone lines, radio waves, satellites or infrared light beams

* Two very common types of networks are LAN and WAN

#### LAN (Local Area Network)

* A local area network (LAN) is a network that is confined to relatively small area. It is generally limited to a geographic area such as writing lab, school or building

* On a single LAN, computers and servers may be connected by cables or wirelessly. Wireless acess to a wired network is made possibly by wireless acess poitns (WAP). These WAP devices provide bridge between computers and networks. A typical WAP might have the theorectical capacity of serving hundreds or even thousands of wireless users to a network, although practical capacity might be far less.

* Nearly always the server will be connected by cables of the network, because the cable connnections tend to be remain the fastest .


#### WAN (Wired Area Network) 

* Wide Area Network (WANs) connect networks in larger geographic areas, such as Florida, United States or the world. Dedicated transcoding cabling or satellite uplinking may be used to connect this types of gloabl networks.

* Using WAN, schools in florida can communicate with the schools in the Japan in a matter of seconds
