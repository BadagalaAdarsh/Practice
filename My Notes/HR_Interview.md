# HR Interview Questions and Answers

## Tell me about yourself

* Good afternoon sir, first of all i would like to thank you for giving me opportunity to introduce myself My self Adarsh, pursuing my B.Tech 3rd year in GMR Institute of Technology. I belong from Hyderabad. My family includes my father who is working as SI in CRPF, my mother she is a home maker. As I am coming from the army background I learned to do things in a disciplined manner. I love painting and writing calligraphy (also called as chirography, longhand, pencraft && fonts of calligraphy arizonia, Bolina, sophia). I can work efficiently both as an individual and as a team player. I am a quick learner. My strengths are hard working and team worker.

## What are your greatest strengths

* I am Hard Working ( Because I have really worked hard to complete some of my complicated projects)
* I am a very good team player( Being in ACM student chapter, me with my team have organized very good events such as quizes and workshops where we shared our knowledge with our juniors and friends)
* I am flexible ( i have faced some of the unexpected situations where I needed to take the right decision very quick like recently i was organizing the codeathon for my juniors where one of our faculty account through which we were going to conduct the codeathon was freezed due to some reasons, and it happened 12 hours before the codeathon, so at that time we have two options either to cancel the event as all the questions and test cases are present in that account or some how conduct the event . I choose second option and in that given time I was able to change the platform, prepare questions on my own from different sources, create testcases for them and deploy them. Finally I was able to conduct the codeathon succesfully even after facing some of the unexpected situations at the very last minute )
* I considered this flexible because even though it is very common for me that i work late night but coming to some important events like this i always prefer to complete the given task much before the deadline so that i have enough time to check for any loop holes in it

## Do you have any blind spots

* I have trouble saying **NO** to people, because of which I ended up being in stressful situation where I needed to manage my personal work, college work and the work given by them simultaneously. But still I managed to balance the workload and get things done. ( Eg Some of my seniors started a free lancing work known as the inquisitive where they were hosting all the educational blogs, I was given the work of writing programs for some questins in 3 languages C, java and python at the same time i was having my MID exams and I was also working on my personal projects, It was really a bit stressful situtaion for me to work on those many things simultaneouly but at the end I was able to finish all my jobs perfectly and ontime)
* But because of this I learnt to work in stressful situations and complete the given task on time.
* Later on I slowly learned to say NO to some of the things which put me on stress.
