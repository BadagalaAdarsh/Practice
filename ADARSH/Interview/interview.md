### Customer Obsession

* Tell me about a time when you were not able to meet a time commitment. What prevented you from meeting it? What was the outcome and what did you learn from it? (customer obsession)\
* Give me an example of a time when you did not meet a client’s expectation. What happened, and how did you attempt to rectify the situation?
* **Answer :** In the recent time, I was given a task in my internship to get all the attributes for the given client for a search engine. There were so many product categories in them and they were mostly focused on health sector, which were placed in middle of catalog for some reason. I started the task from the begining of the catalog only to find out that they are not the important ones, and instead I should have started from the ones where most people buy the products. Luckily I found out this a day before and started working on it in the weekends and was able to deliver the result and the good news is the customer liked the presentation and working of our demo and we are soon going to serve them in other fields as well. From this I learnt that when a customer gives us the task it may not be possible to get it all done due to various reasons, so we should always work on the stuff which is going to make most of the impact with least amount of work done to that point

* Describe for me how you have demonstrated customer obsession?
* **Answer :** In any given situation, I start with the customer and work backward. My sole intention is to provide an amazing customer experience, even if that means going out of my way to exceed their expectations on the service that I give them. I understand that it is not only about earning their trust, but also keeping their trust by consistently and continually providing great customer experience

* Walk us through a time when you helped a customer through a difficult process and what that looked like? (customer obsession, owenership)
* **Answer :** Well currenlty I am a fresher, so I don't have much of a real life experience but as I said earlier I am currently that Vice Chair of ACM student chapter, where a part of our job was to main  a web site in C panel and as the time passes we should hand over it to our next peers at that, from the intial KT (knowledge transfer) they mis understood some of the concepts and they messed up the website luckily I kept a backup, I restored the website later I told them precisely how to use it and and made sure that they clearly understand it and able to operate it safely

* Tell the story of the last time you had to apologize to someone (vocally self - critical)
* **Answer** Me and my team were working on a project for the end semester in our 4th sem. My friend proposed a method to solve a particular problem but I rejected thinking that it would slow down and lower the quality, however during the last minute rush, we used the new method which ended up being the great success. I apologized to the new member on not having confidence in him at first
that task regarding normalization of a table for free time management system web app

* Tell me about a time when you changed your process to better align with customer needs.
* Tell me about a time you handled a difficult customer. What did you do? How did you manage the customer? What was her/his reaction? What was the outcome?
* Tell me about a time when you were 75% through a project & you had to pivot strategy
* Who was your most challenging customer?(Customer obsession)
* Give me an example of a time when you did not meet a client’s expectation. What happened, and how did you attempt to rectify the situation?
* Tell me about a time you used customer feedback to change the way you worked.


* **Answer :** In  my recent task, I was working on enhancing the recommendation engine, initially I thought I would do it in the usual regular expression manner as it was working good with most of the products related to weight loss, but customer asked to make sure it would work for all of them so I changed approach categorize products based on the benefits that they offer and give recommendation accordingly. they were satisfied with our approach and they onboarded with us as a new customer
* The style of my work changed after a customer told me the details that I have to focus on vary from one customer to another and that I have to approach every project with a clear and open min


* When you’re working with a large number of customers, it’s tricky to deliver excellent service to them all. So how do you go about prioritizing your customers’ needs?(customer obsession, ownership)
* **Answer :** I believe in approaching each and every customer requirement with the same level of attention at first.Properly understanding the gap between importance and satisfaction is important when prioritizing each customer’s need. I would give priority for the important and expected features or demands first, and fulfill the requirements focusing satisfaction and delight after. It is all about recognizing the vital few from the trivial many


*  Most of us, at one time, have felt frustrated or impatient when dealing with customers. Can you tell me about a time when you felt this way and how you dealt with it?

* **Answer** in my second year i was helping one of my seniors starup the inquisitve where my task was to gather questions for a assesment that they were preparing for a customer which is a school and also to make a poster to promote it. for some reason customer was asking for so many changes repeatedly both in assesment question and in the poster. I got bit irritated by both the customer and senior as he was asking so many things to do, then I just reminded my self that this is not a personal attack against me. I kept myself calm and taking some time and later finished the work as expected by  my senior and the customer

* When do you think it is okay to push back or say no to an unreasonable customer request?

* **Answer** As of now I didn't faced such kind of situation due to lack of experience but I, personally, believe that there is always a solution to a problem. Regardless of how difficult it is, I will truly try my best to fulfill a request by a customer or at least meet them halfway. I would say no to a customer only if their request is simply not realistic, or expected me to directly break company policies


* How do you develop client relationships?(customer obsession, earning trust, deliver result)

* **Answer :** I believe that when it comes to developing any kind of relationship, communication is the key. I will always be efficient with my communication in my client relationships with an attitude that shows them I truly value customer satisfaction. I believe that maintaining the integrity and being transparent with my objectives are also essential to developing good client relationships.

*  Tell me about a time you had to compromise in order to satisfy a customer.

* **Answer :** I tend to keep a healthy work life balance so that my productivity never goes down and it always increases but for qalara I had to compromise my generous holiday vacation time for myself where I planned to go home but  to make sure that the new client would like the demo but customer liking the demo and onboarding with us as the new customer made it all worth it

*  How do you get to an understanding of what the customer’s needs are?
* **Answer** currently I am working as a data scientist where I am learning both the SDE and data science part. Here the customers come to us without much technical knowledge of what they require and can only provide me with the details of the aesthetic that they expect in the final product. I believe that great customer service is not only about doing what they ask us to do but about anticipating what they truly require and exceeding their expectation.

* How do you anticipate your customer’s needs ? (Customer Obsession, Innovation, thinking beyond limits and deliver great results)
* **Answer** I tried to be updated in their field of business and think in the point of the customer of my current customer and why would I choose him instead of others in the same field and in  that way I'll try to understand the customer's need

* How do you honestly pursue customer feedback, not just solicit them for compliments?
* **Answer** I always start with making sure I provide a perfect service that encourages the customer to leave feedback on their own without having solicit(ask them separately) When I do pursue feedback, I always do it with clear intent and a purpose, explaining to my customer that what I require is constructive feedback and not simply a positive comment


*  How do you wow your customers ?
* **Answer** Giving the wow factor to a customer is all about pleasantly surprising them by providing a level of service that exceeds their expectations. This should be started with perfect delivery of service along with a positive addition that they do not usually get from the competitors. In my recent task of herbspro along with regular expression one for recommendation I also gave them benefit based approach and for qalara along with the parent one I was able to give leaf level products in the search query


* Tell me about a time a customer wanted one thing, but you felt they needed something else.

* **Answer** for herbspro I was told that they need a exact match for the recommendation example for weight gain or weight loss. But I just thought in terms of general customer and I felt that it's not always the case some times the general customer might want a simple one which does the same work instead of the exact same one

* When was a time you had to balance the needs of the customer with the needs of the business?
* **Answer** This is something that comes up mostly with product pricing and offering discounts and other incentives to the customer. My approach is always thinking about long-term benefits for the business and retention of the customer rather than making a short-term profit and losing the customer

* Give me an example of when you took a risk and it failed.
* **Answer** we planned as a ACM student chapter a workshop on machine learning and deep learning as most of students asked for that and we arranged a resource person for a pariticular fee but at the event time we failed to meet the min required reg and fee cause there were few continuous holidays in the hostel, so most of the hostlers left home and we paid the resource person from our money. Here two learning were first we should know whether our customer available at a particular time and never promise a resource person that we can pay him upfront


* Describe a project or idea (not necessarily your own that was implemented primarily because of your efforts. What was your role? What was the outcome?
* Give an example of when you saw a peer struggling and decided to step in and help. What was the situation and what action did you take? What was the outcome?

* **Answer** in college my juniors wanted to implement a project for their main project in deep learning based on classification but they didn't had any idea. I told them to do on ASL using VGG16 as it is pretrained network. I helped them in teaching some of the stuff that I know and it turned out that their project was selected as one of the best project in the class

* Tell me about a time when you had to leave a task unfinished?
* **Answer** in internship i was initially told that I have to extract attributes from the website for all the catalogs or atleast some by going through some, but i found that later i could have done the same based on the customer given data so I told my mentor about it and left it and proceeded with web scraping approach which indeed saved us lot of time later

*  tell me about a time when you had to work on a project with unclear responsibilities?
* **Answer** In my internship i was just told to get as many attributes as possible from a website where I was unclear about why to do or for what they'll be used. But I did what I can do and soon it turned out that I have performed well because of which the customer was very happy


* Give me an example of a decision you owned, which had a long-term focus.(higher standards, diving deep, delivering results)
* **Answer** I am tech lead and vice chair of ACM and we conduct various codeathons and making questions and resutls were taking so much time because of lack of test cases and checking the palagarism, then I came up with a solution to give random test cases from the recent codeforces and codechef contest and use simple python programs to automate the plag check, although it took some time to get it right , it really helped in fastening the process of creating a questions and providiing results

* Provide an example of when you personally demonstrated ownership.
* **Answer** for hackathon juniors were responsible for preparing the questions but at last moment due to various reasons they were unable to do it as they were forced to do some courses so they lacked the time and I prepared questions, poster to promote, took the responsibilty for the promotions, arranged the lab, and at the time of event there was some issue with internet routed initially i tried to resolve it in normal manner but I couldn't then I discover that it was a individual router so for the sake of codeathon i rested the router provided the internet later I dive deep into the problem using the network administrator and solved the issue and finally that event went in a very good manner


### Ownership

* Give me an example of a time you faced a conflict while working on a team. How did you handle that? (ownership)
* Do you collaborate well
* **Answer** in our student chapter there was a delay in the work because of a particular team mate whose responsibilty was to create questions for the deep datathon, then I approached so that i can know how to over come it, he initially reacted defensively, I kept calm and asked him how could I assist him, then he told that his teacher has given him one more assignment to do because of which he was unable to finish the job. So I approached our faculty sponsor and explained him the current situation and later his assignment was reduced and I too helped him a bit in  my free time to complete the work in time

* Tell me about a time when you took on a task that was beyond your job responsibilities.
* Took on a task that went beyond your typical responsibilities?
* **Answer** for hackathon juniors were responsible for preparing the questions but at last moment due to various reasons they were unable to do it as they were forced to do some courses so they lacked the time and I prepared questions, poster to promote, took the responsibilty for the promotions, arranged the lab, and at the time of event there was some issue with internet routed initially i tried to resolve it in normal manner but I couldn't then I discover that it was a individual router so for the sake of codeathon i rested the router provided the internet later I dive deep into the problem using the network administrator and solved the issue and finally that event went in a very good manner

* Took it upon yourself to work on a thought-provoking initiative.
* **Answer** in our ACM student chapter, every time we need to update the data in cpanel which is good by some tiredsome so i decided a taken a initiative to create a admin panel so that later it would be much easy and save us a lot of time. similar thing I have advised in inquisitive though i was not officialy not part of it and I don't know much about web development

* Tell me about a time you stepped up into a leadership role
* Tell me about a time when you effectively used your judgment to solve a problem.
* **Answer** there was a discussion why studnets are not interested in coding in a meeting, asked us to do something about it. I stepped up and told that it is due to lack of motivation and may be difficulty of questions that they are trying to solve as a beginner(hard at beginning) so they assigned a task to me to teach juniors some topics like graph and trees, I gathered all the resources from various sources, there are so many so found few, compressed them to little taught them in a simple manner and gave practice questoins later organized the event this strategy I have applied the same in recent deep datathon

Hugging face transformers model, BERT NER pipeline, actually top class is a pipe line, in pipe line batch size change ayye koddi predictions change avutai and metrics change avutai ( NER metrics , precion, recal change avutai ) appudu code motham choosanu ( BERT NER github transformers open source library github lo ki velli motham choosanu ) choosaka, na previous experience and code choosi max lenght change avutu untundi kabati predictins and parameters change avutunnai ani ardham ayyindi. so problem fix cheyyadaniki libray lo ki velli (by default manam max lenght ni chagne cheyyalem) code choosi aa class lo undo find out chesi dani inherit chesi custom class and method use chesanu so that ee custom class ki we can pass max lenght as a parameter.

processing anedi batch wise jarugutndi (general ga unna batch lo maximum lenght unnadi teesukuntadi) but ala prathi batch change avutundi so prediciotns kuda change ayyevi, so max lenght might be reason for the problem,

so kind of hyper parameter laa veeru veru vatitho try chesam as of now 100 danitho we are getting reasonable results

attribute extraction automate cheyyadaniki and still reserach jarugutndi and present nenu verey team lo unnanu

* What do you believe that no one else does?
* **Anser** in past all told I can't build logic or programming without actually practicing it, I do believe that but I also believe there are other alternatives to do so, so initially I practiced on paper just the logic part, maths important for ML, cannot do NPTEL courses along with current Academics without laptop will be so much stressfull but I proved them wrong


### Deliver Results

* By providing an example, tell me when you have had to handle a variety of assignments. Describe the results.

**What is DNS lookup?**

A DNS lookup, in a general sense, is the process by which a DNS record is returned from a DNS server. This is like looking up a phone number in a phone book - that is why it is referred to as a "lookup". Interconnected computers, servers and smart phones need to know how to translate the email addresses and domain names people use into meaningful numerical addresses. A DNS lookup performs this function

The basic idea of DNS is that humans can't easily remember long strings of digits like machines can, but can much more easily remember words. So, when you type in a domain name like www.techopedia.com, the request is forwarded to a DNS server (whether locally or at an ISP), which returns the corresponding IP address. This address is then used by all the computers and routers to channel the request and responses of a user's session. The result is the user sees web pages as expected or has email show up in an in-box. The two types of DNS lookups are forward DNS lookups and reverse DNS lookups.

DNS lookups utilize DNS records to translate IP addresses and domain names or email addresses. There are two types of lookups: forward DNS and reverse DNS. Both resolve information related to the domain, depending on the search method


**What is forward DNS Mean?**

Forward DNS is a type of DNS request in which a domain name is used to obtain its corresponding IP address. A DNS server is said to resolve a domain name when it returns its IP address. A forward DNS request is the opposite of a reverse DNS lookup.

Forward DNS is also known as a forward DNS lookup

**What does reverse DNS (rDNS) mean?**

Reverse DNS (rDNS or RDNS) is a Domain Name Service (DNS) lookup of a domain name from an IP address. A regular DNS request would resolve an IP address given a domain name; hence the name "reverse."

Reverse DNS is also known as Reverse DNS Lookup and Inverse DNS

Reverse DNS requests are often used for filtering spam. Spammers can easily set the sending email address using any domain name they want, including legitimate domain names like those of banks or trusted organizations.

Receiving email servers can validate incoming messages by checking the sending IP address with a Reverse DNS request. If the email is legitimate, the rDNS resolver should match the domain of the email address. The downside with this technique is that some legitimate mail servers don't have the proper rDNS records setup on their end to respond properly because in many cases their ISP has to set these records up.

Reverse DNS records can be set up for both ipV4 and ipV6 records.


**What does DNS Record Mean?**

A DNS record is a database record used to map a URL to an IP address. DNS records are stored in DNS servers and work to help users connect their websites to the outside world. When the URL is entered and searched in the browser, that URL is forwarded to the DNS servers and then directed to the specific Web server. This Web server then serves the queried website outlined in the URL or directs the user to an email server that manages the incoming mail.

The most common record types are A (address), CNAME (canonical name), MX (mail exchange), NS (name server), PTR (pointer), SOA (start of authority) and TXT (text record)


**What does domain name registrar mean?**

A domain name registrar is company that has been accredited by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) or a national country code top-level domain (TLD) (such as .uk or .ca) to register domain names. Domain name registration is a competitive industry, in which domains may be sold in a number of TLDs, including ".com," ".net," and ".org." among others


**Networking Protocols in Computer Networks**

* Transmission Control Protocol (TCP): TCP is a popular communication protocol which is used for communicating over a network. It divides any message into series of packets that are sent from source to destination and there it gets reassembled at the destination.

* Internet Protocol (IP): IP is designed explicitly as addressing protocol. It is mostly used with TCP. The IP addresses in packets help in routing them through different nodes in a network until it reaches the destination system. TCP/IP is the most popular protocol connecting the networks.

* User Datagram Protocol (UDP): UDP is a substitute communication protocol to Transmission Control Protocol implemented primarily for creating loss-tolerating and low-latency linking between different applications

* Post office Protocol (POP): POP3 is designed for receiving incoming E-mails

* Simple mail transport Protocol (SMTP): SMTP is designed to send and distribute outgoing E-Mail.


* File Transfer Protocol (FTP): FTP allows users to transfer files from one machine to another. Types of files may include program files, multimedia files, text files, and documents, etc

* PPP: Point to Point Protocol or PPP is a data link layer protocol that enables transmission of TCP/IP traffic over serial connection, like telephone line.

* Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP): HTTP is designed for transferring a hypertext among two or more systems. HTML tags are used for creating links. These links may be in any form like text or images. HTTP is designed on Client-server principles which allow a client system for establishing a connection with the server machine for making a request. The server acknowledges the request initiated by the client and responds accordingly

* Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS): HTTPS is abbreviated as Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure is a standard protocol to secure the communication among two computers one using the browser and other fetching data from web server. HTTP is used for transferring data between the client browser (request) and the web server (response) in the hypertext format, same in case of HTTPS except that the transferring of data is done in an encrypted format. So it can be said that https thwart hackers from interpretation or modification of data throughout the transfer of packets

* Telnet: Telnet is a set of rules designed for connecting one system with another. The connecting process here is termed as remote login. The system which requests for connection is the local computer, and the system which accepts the connection is the remote computer

* Gopher: Gopher is a collection of rules implemented for searching, retrieving as well as displaying documents from isolated sites. Gopher also works on the client/server principle

* Some Other Protocols are
    * ARP (Address Resolution Protocl)
    * DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)
    * IMAP4 (Internet Message Access Protocol)
    * SIP (Session Initiation Protocol)
    * RTP (Real-time Transport Protocol)
    * RLP (Resource Location Protocol)
    * RAP (Route Access Protocol)
    * L2TP (Layer Two Tunnelling Protocol)
    * PPTP ( Point to point tunnelling protocol)
    * SNMP ( simple network management protocol)
    * TFTP (Trivial File Transfer Protocol)


**Encryption**

Network encryption is the process of encrypting or encoding data and messages transmitted or communicated over a computer network. It is a broad process that includes various tools, techniques and standards to ensure that the messages are unreadable when in transit between two or more network nodes


**Difference between delete, truncate and drop in DBMS**

* Delete
Basically, it is a Data Manipulation Language Command (DML). It is used to delete one or more tuples of a table. With the help of the “DELETE” command, we can either delete all the rows in one go or can delete rows one by one. i.e., we can use it as per the requirement or the condition using the Where clause. It is comparatively slower than the TRUNCATE command. The TRUNCATE command does not remove the structure of the table.

* Drop
It is a Data Definition Language Command (DDL). It is used to drop the whole table. With the help of the “DROP” command we can drop (delete) the whole structure in one go i.e. it removes the named elements of the schema. By using this command the existence of the whole table is finished or say lost

* Truncate
It is also a Data Definition Language Command (DDL). It is used to delete all the rows of a relation (table) in one go. With the help of the “TRUNCATE” command, we can’t delete the single row as here WHERE clause is not used. By using this command the existence of all the rows of the table is lost. It is comparatively faster than the delete command as it deletes all the rows fastly. 


**Difference between candidate key and super key**

Super Key is a set of attributes or columns that uniquely identifies each row table whereas, a candidate key is a set of attributes that recognizes the tuples in a relation, or table

**Difference between unique and distinct in DBMS**

The UNIQUE keyword marks a database constraint and is defined during table creation or later on a specific column or a set of columns. The DISTINCT keyword is used while fetching the result set from the database

## Operating System

**What is the main purpose of an operating system? Discuss different types?**

An operating system (OS) is system software that manages computer hardware, software resources, and provides common services for computer programs. So it manages the computer’s memory, processes, devices, files, and security aspects of the system. It also allows us to communicate with the computer without knowing how to speak the computer’s language. Without an operating system, a computer is not useful.

Types of operating system:

- Batch OS
- Distributed OS
- Multitasking OS
- Network OS
- Real-Time OS
- Mobile OS

**What is a socket, kernel and monolithic kernel ?**

- Socket:
A socket is defined as an endpoint for communication, A pair of processes communicating over a network employ a pair of sockets ,one for each process. A socket is identified by an IP address concatenated with a port number.
The server waits for incoming client requests by listening to a specified port. Once a request is received, the server accepts a connection from the client socket to complete the connection.

- Kernel is the central core component of an operating system that manages operations of computer and hardware. Kernel Establishes communication between user level application and hardware. Manages memory and CPU time. Decides state of incoming processes. Controls Disk, Memory, Task Management

- Monolithic Kernel (provides good performance but lots of lines of code)
It is one of the types of kernel where all operating system services operate in kernel space. It has dependencies between system components. It has huge lines of code which is complex.
Example : Unix, Linux, Open VMS, XTS-400 etc.


**Difference between process and program and thread? Different types of process**

- Process:
Process is an instance of an executing program. For example, we write our computer programs in a text file and when we execute this program, it becomes a process which performs all the tasks mentioned in the program.

- Program:
Program is a set of instructions to perform a certain task. Eg: chrome.exe, notepad.exe

- Thread:
Thread is a path of execution within a process. A thread is also known as a lightweight process. The idea is to achieve parallelism by dividing a process into multiple threads. For example,Word processor uses multiple threads: one thread to format the text, another thread to process inputs.


**Define virtual memory, thrashing, threads**

- **Virtual Memory:**
A computer can address more memory than the amount physically installed on the system. This extra memory is actually called virtual memory and it is a section of a hard disk that’s set up to emulate the computer’s RAM.
The main visible advantage of this scheme is that programs can be larger than physical memory. Virtual memory serves two purposes. First, it allows us to extend the use of physical memory by using a disk. Second, it allows us to have memory protection, because each virtual address is translated to a physical address. (Example Swap in Linux)

- **Thrashing:**
Thrashing is a condition or a situation when the system is spending a major portion of its time in servicing the **page faults** <mark>(In computing, a page fault (sometimes called PF or hard fault) is an exception that the memory management unit (MMU) raises when a process accesses a memory page without proper preparations. Accessing the page requires a mapping to be added to the process's virtual address space)</mark> , but the actual processing done is very negligible. High degree of multiprogramming(if number of processes keeps on increasing in the memory), lack of frames (if a process is allocated too few frames, then there will be too many and too frequent page faults) causes Thrashing.

    * **Page** (or memory page, or virtual page, or logical page) is a fixed-length contiguous block of <mark>virtual memory</mark>

    * A **frame** (or memory frame, or physical page, or page frame) is a fixed-length block of <mark>RAM</mark> (ie. physical memory, it exists - as in <mark>physical<mark/>

        * It is the smallest unit of data for memory management in a virtual memory operating system. A frame refers to a storage frame or central storage frame. In terms of physical memory, it is a fixed sized block in physical memory space, or a block of central storage

        

- **Threads:**
A thread is a single sequential flow of execution of tasks of a process so it is also known as thread of execution or thread of control


**What is RAID ? Different types**

RAID, or <mark>Redundant Arrays of Independent Disks</mark> is a technique which makes use of a combination of multiple disks instead of using a single disk for increased performance, data redundancy or both.Data redundancy, although taking up extra space, adds to disk reliability. This means, in case of disk failure, if the same data is also backed up onto another disk, we can retrieve the data and go on with the operation


* **RAID 0**
    * RAID level 0, often called <mark>stripping</mark> The idea behind this level is data to be stored is divided into some parts called strips and loaded these strips across the member of the disk of the array

        * Advantages
            * Very Fast
            * Performance Oriented Disk Mapping Method
            * Performance is better than single drive since the workload is balanced by the array memebers
            * useful for high - performance systems

        * Disadvantages
            * No redundancy of data
            * No fault tolerance
            * any disk member fails, it affects the entire array


* **RAID 1**
    * RAID level 1 uses at least two duplicate hard drives and store the same blocks of information between them. So, it is often called <mark>Mirroring</mark>. If one of the mirrored drives failure due to a mechanical problem or does not respond then the remaining drive will continue to serve and provide correct data.

        * Advantages
            * High Reliability
            * Fault tolerance, recovery from failure is simple
            * Good Performance

        * Disadvantages
            * Costly because of mirroring of data
            * Min 2 drives are required      

* **RAID 2**
    * RAID level is called <mark>Hamming code</mark> The strips are very small at this level, often as small as a single byte or word. The hamming code is calculated across corresponding bit positions on each data disk and the bits of the code are stored in the corresponding bit positions on multiple disks

        * Disadvantages
            * Its rarely implemented (RAID 2 controller was expensive and hard to implement)  


* **RAID 3**
    * RAID level 3 requires only a <mark>single redundant disk</mark>. RAID 3 employs parallel access with data distributed in small strips. Instead of an error corresponding code, a single <mark>parity bit</mark> is computed for the set of individual bits in the same position on all of the data disks. In the event of a drive failure, the parity drive is accessed and data is reconstructed from the remaining devices

        * Advantages
            * RAID 3 can achieve very high data transfer rates
            * Any I/O request will involve the parallel transfer of data from all of the data disks

        * Disadvantages
            * RAID level 3 is also rarely implemented (because of below draw back)
            * Only processes one I/O at a time

* **RAID 4**
    * RAID 4 <mark>stripes</mark> the data across multiple disks just like RAID 0. In addition to that, it also stores <mark>parity information</mark> of all the disks in a separate dedicated disk to achieve redundancy. If one of the data disks failed is the information re-built on a separate disk using the parity information. If the parity disk fails, the parity information is recalculated on a spare disk. It is better suited to the transaction I/O rather than large file transfers.

    * Advantages
            * RAID 4 can recover data from one lost disk


* **RAID 5**
    * It is the most common type of RAID level 5. It distributes the parity strips across all disks. RAID 5 eliminates the write bottlenecks. The only it has is the parity calculations process. But with modern CPUs and software of RAID that is not even a very big bottleneck

        * Advantages
            * Highest (read) data transmission rate
            * Low Ration of ECC (Parity) disks to data disks, means high efficiency.

        * Disadvantages
            * Most Complex controller design
            * Difficult to rebuilt in the event of disk failure
            * High overhead for small writes. to change 1 byte in a file, the entire strip must be read, the byte changed, the parity information recalculated and the entire stripe rewritten


* **RAID 6**
    * In RAID 6 method, two different parity calculations are carried out and stored in separate blocks on different disks. So, this scheme needs N+2 disks (2 for parity).

        * Advantages:
            * Privides extremely high data availability

* There are also other RAID like software RAID and hardware RAID


**What is a deadlock? Different conditions to achieve a deadlock**

A Deadlock is a situation where each of the computer processes waits for a resource which is being assigned to some other process. In this situation, none of the processes gets executed since the resource it needs is held by some other process which is also waiting for some other resource to be released.

How deadlock is achieved: Deadlock happens when Mutual exclusion, hold and wait, No preemption and circular wait occurs simultaneously.

Necessary Conditions for deadlock:

- Mutual Exclusion
- Hold and Wait
- No preemption
- Circular Wait

**What is fragmentation? Types of fragmentation**

The conditions of fragmentation depend on the memory allocation system. As the process is loaded and unloaded from memory, these areas are fragmented into small pieces of memory that cannot be allocated to incoming processes. It is called fragmentation


* Internal Fragmentation

    ![Internal Fragmentation](https://static.javatpoint.com/operating-system/images/internal-vs-external-fragmentation2.png)


* External Fragmentation
    ![External Fragmentation](https://static.javatpoint.com/operating-system/images/internal-vs-external-fragmentation3.png)


**What is spooling ?**

SPOOL is an acronym for <mark>simultaneous peripheral operations online</mark>. Spooling is a process in which data is temporarily held to be used and executed by a device, program, or system.
In spooling, there is no interaction between the I/O devices and the CPU. That means there is no need for the CPU to wait for the I/O operations to take place. Such operations take a long time to finish executing, so the CPU will not wait for them to finish.
The biggest example of Spooling is printing. The documents which are to be printed are stored in the SPOOL and then added to the queue for printing. During this time, many processes can perform their operations and use the CPU without waiting while the printer executes the printing process on the documents one-by-on


**What is semaphore and mutex (Differences might be asked)? Define Binary semaphore**

* Mutex
A mutex provides mutual exclusion, either producer or consumer can have the key (mutex) and proceed with their work. As long as the buffer is filled by the producer, the consumer needs to wait, and vice versa. 
At any point of time, only one thread can work with the entire buffer. The concept can be generalized using semaphore. 
A mutex is a locking mechanism used to synchronize access to a resource. Only one task (can be a thread or process based on OS abstraction) can acquire the mutex. It means there is ownership associated with a mutex, and only the owner can release the lock (mutex). 


* Semaphore (faster than mutex)
A semaphore is a generalized mutex. In lieu of a single buffer, we can split the 4 KB buffer into four 1 KB buffers (identical resources). A semaphore can be associated with these four buffers. The consumer and producer can work on different buffers at the same time. 
Semaphore is signaling mechanism (“I am done, you can carry on” kind of signal). For example, if you are listening to songs (assume it as one task) on your mobile phone and at the same time, your friend calls you, an interrupt is triggered upon which an interrupt service routine (ISR) signals the call processing task to wakeup

* Binary Semaphore
Definition. A Binary Semaphore is a semaphore whose integer value range over 0 and 1. A counting semaphore is a semaphore that has multiple values of the counter. The value can range over an unrestricted domain

<mark>The critical section refers to the segment of code where processes access shared resources, such as common variables and files, and perform write operations on them. Since processes execute concurrently, any process can be interrupted mid-execution</mark>


**Belady’s Anomaly**

Bélády’s anomaly is the name given to the phenomenon where increasing the number of page frames results in an increase in the number of page faults for a given memory access pattern

* Solution to fix Belady’s Anomaly:
Implementing alternative page replacement algo helps eliminate Belady’s Anomaly.. Use of stack based algorithms, such as Optimal Page Replacement Algorithm and Least Recently Used (LRU) algorithm, can eliminate the issue of increased page faults as these algorithms assign priority to pages

**Starving and Aging in OS**

Starving/Starvation(also called Lived lock): Starvation is the problem that occurs when low priority processes get jammed for an unspecified time as the high priority processes keep executing. So starvation happens if a method is indefinitely delayed.

Solution to Starvation : Ageing is a technique of gradually increasing the priority of processes that wait in the system for a long time.

**Why does trashing occur?**

High degree of multiprogramming(if number of processes keeps on increasing in the memory) , lack of frames(if a process is allocated too few frames, then there will be too many and too frequent page faults.) causes Thrashing.

**What is paging and why do we need it?**

Paging is a function of memory management where a computer will store and retrieve data from a device's secondary storage to the primary storage. Memory management is a crucial aspect of any computing device, and paging specifically is important to the implementation of virtual memory

Paging is used for faster access to data. When a program needs a page, it is available in the main memory as the OS copies a certain number of pages from your storage device to main memory. Paging allows the physical address space of a process to be noncontiguous.

Page Hit. When the CPU attempts to obtain a needed page from main memory and the page exists in main memory (RAM), it is referred to as a <mark>PAGE HIT</mark>

Overview. In an operating system, page replacement is referred to a scenario in which a page from the main memory should be replaced by a page from secondary memory. Page replacement occurs due to page faults



**Demand Paging, Segmentation**

Demand paging is a method of virtual memory management which is based on the principle that pages should only be brought into memory if the executing process demands them. This is often referred to as lazy evaluation as only those pages demanded by the process are swapped from secondary storage to main memory.
So demand paging works opposite to the principle of loading all pages immediately.

Segmentation is a memory management technique in which the memory is divided into the variable size parts. Each part is known as a segment which can be allocated to a process.

The details about each segment are stored in a table called a segment table. Segment table is stored in one (or many) of the segments.

Segment table contains mainly two information about segment:

Base: It is the base address of the segment
Limit: It is the length of the segment


**Real Time Operating System, types of RTOS**

A real-time operating system (RTOS) is a special-purpose operating system used in computers that has strict time constraints for any job to be performed and is intended to serve real time applications that possess data as it comes in , typically without buffer delays.

Example Flight control, real time simulation

Types of RTOS:

Hard RTOS
Firm RTOS
Soft RTOS


**Difference between main memory and secondary memory.**


* Primary memory is the computer memory that is directly accessible by CPU. It is comprised of DRAM and provides the actual working space to the processor. It holds the data and instructions that the processor is currently working on (RAM, ROM (computer chips), Cache,PROM, Register etc)

* The contents of the secondary memory first get transferred to the primary memory and then are accessed by the processor, this is because the processor does not directly interact with the secondary memory (hard Disk, Floppy Disk, Magnetic Tapes etc)

**Dynamic Binding**

Static binding happens when the code is compiled, while dynamic bind happens when the code is executed at run time.

* Static Binding
When a compiler acknowledges all the information required to call a function or all the values of the variables during compile time, it is called “static binding”. As all the required information is known before runtime, it increases the program efficiency and it also enhances the speed of execution of a program. Static Binding makes a program very efficient, but it declines the program flexibility, as ‘values of variable’ and ‘function calling’ are predefined in the program. Static binding is implemented in a program at the time of coding. Overloading a function or an operator is the example of compile time polymorphism i.e. static binding

* Dynamic Binding
 Calling a function or assigning a value to a variable, at run-time is called “Dynamic Binding”. Dynamic binding can be associated with run time ‘polymorphism’ and ‘inheritance’ in OOP. Dynamic binding makes the execution of a program flexible as it can decide what value should be assigned to the variable and which function should be called, at the time of program execution. But as this information is provided at run time it makes the execution slower as compared to static binding


 **FCFS Scheduling**

First Come First Serve (FCFS) is an operating system scheduling algorithm that automatically executes queued requests and processes in order of their arrival. It is the easiest and simplest CPU scheduling algorithm. In this type of algorithm, processes which requests the CPU first get the CPU allocation first

**SJF Scheduling**

Shortest Job First (SJF) is an algorithm in which the process having the smallest execution time is chosen for the next execution. This scheduling method can be preemptive or non-preemptive. It significantly reduces the average waiting time for other processes awaiting execution

<mark>non pre emptive</mark>  does not interrupt a process running CPU in middle of execution

<mark>pre emptive</mark> program can be interrupted

**SRTF Scheduling**

SRTF Scheduling is a preemptive version of SJF scheduling. In SRTF, the execution of the process can be stopped after a certain amount of time. At the arrival of every process, the short term scheduler schedules the process with the least remaining burst time among the list of available processes and the running process

* Completion Time (CT): This is the time when the process completes it’s execution.

* Arrival Time (AT): This is the time when the process has arrived in the ready state.

* Waiting Time (WT):
The time spent by a process waiting in the ready queue for getting the CPU.
The time difference b/w Turnaround Time and Burst Time is called Waiting Time.

* Burst Time (BT): This is the time required by the process for it’s execution

* Turn around Time (TAT): Burst time + Waiting Time

**LRTF Scheduling**

This is a preemptive version of Longest Job First (LJF) scheduling algorithm. In this scheduling algorithm, we find the process with the maximum remaining time and then process it. We check for the maximum remaining time after some interval of time(say 1 unit each) to check if another process having more Burst Time arrived up to that time

**Priority Scheduling**

Priority Scheduling is a method of scheduling processes that is based on priority. In this algorithm, the scheduler selects the tasks to work as per the priority.

The processes with higher priority should be carried out first, whereas jobs with equal priorities are carried out on a round-robin or FCFS basis. Priority depends upon memory requirements, time requirements, etc


**Round Robin Scheduling**

In Round-robin scheduling, each ready task runs turn by turn only in a cyclic queue for a limited time slice. This algorithm also offers starvation free execution of processes. Widely used preemptive scheduling method in traditional OS. All the jobs get a fair allocation of CPU. 
* Cons include : Finding a correct time quantum is a quite difficult task in this system, Round-robin scheduling doesn’t give special priority to more important tasks


**Producer Consumer Problem**

About Producer-Consumer problem: The Producer-Consumer problem is a classic problem that is used for multi-process synchronisation i.e. synchronisation between more than one processes.

The job of the Producer is to generate the data, put it into the buffer, and again start generating data. While the job of the Consumer is to consume the data from the buffer.

What’s the problem here?
The following are the problems that might occur in the Producer-Consumer:

The producer should produce data only when the buffer is not full. If the buffer is full, then the producer shouldn’t be allowed to put any data into the buffer.
The consumer should consume data only when the buffer is not empty. If the buffer is empty, then the consumer shouldn’t be allowed to take any data from the buffer.
The producer and consumer should not access the buffer at the same time.

We can solve this problem by using semaphores


**Banker’s Algorithm**

The banker’s algorithm is a resource allocation and deadlock avoidance algorithm that tests for safety by simulating the allocation for predetermined maximum possible amounts of all resources, then makes an “s-state” check to test for possible activities, before deciding whether allocation should be allowed to continue.
The banker’s algorithm is named because it checks whether a person should be sanctioned a loan amount or not to help the bank system safely simulate allocation resources.



**Explain Cache**

Cache is a type of memory that is used to increase the speed of data access. Normally, the data required for any process resides in the main memory. However, it is transferred to the cache memory temporarily if it is used frequently enough. The process of storing and accessing data from a cache is known as caching.

Cache Memory is a special very high-speed memory. It is used to speed up and synchronizing with high-speed CPU. Cache memory is costlier than main memory or disk memory but economical than CPU registers. Cache memory is an extremely fast memory type that acts as a buffer between RAM and the CPU. It holds frequently requested data and instructions so that they are immediately available to the CPU when needed.

**Fast Memory**

<mark>Level 1 or Register , Level 2 or Cache , Level 3 or Main Memory, Level 4 or Secondary Memory</mark>

**Difference between Direct-mapping, Associative Mapping & Set-Associative Mapping**

* Direct Mapping
Each block from main memory has only one possible place in the cache organization in this technique. 

For example : every block i of the main memory can be mapped to block j of the cache using the formula : 

>j = i modulo m
Where : i = main memory block number
       j = cache block number
       m = number of blocks in the cache

* Associative Mapping
Here the mapping of the main memory block can be done with any of the cache block. The memory address has only 2 fields here : word & tag. This technique is called as fully associative cache mapping.

* Set-Associative Mapping
It is the combination of advantages of both direct & associative mapping. 

    * Cache lines are grouped into sets where each set contains k number of lines
    * A particular block of main memory can map to only one particular set of the cache.
    * However, within that set, the memory block can map to any freely available cache line.
    

**Diff between multitasking and multiprocessing**

* Multi-tasking : 
Multi-tasking is the logical extension of multiprogramming. In this system, the CPU executes multiple jobs by switching among them typically using a small time quantum, and these switches occur so frequently that the users can interact with each program while it is running. Multitasking is further classified into two categories: Single User & Multiuse

*  Multiprocessing : 
Multiprocessing is a system that has two or more than two processors. In this, CPUs are added for increasing computing speed of the system. Because of Multiprocessing, there are many processes that are executed simultaneously. Multiprocessing is further classified into two categories: Symmetric Multiprocessing and Asymmetric Multiprocessing

    * multiprocessing, in computing, a mode of operation in which two or more processors in a computer simultaneously process two or more different portions of the same program (set of instructions).

## Linux Commands

  **What do you understand by Linux Kernal? Is it legal to edit it?**
 
  Answer: ‘Kernal’ basically refers to that core component of the computer operating system that provides basic services for the other parts as well as interacts with user commands. When it comes to ‘Linux Kernal’, it is referred to as low-level system software providing an interface for user-level interactions
 
  Linux Kernal is considered as free and open-source software which is capable of managing hardware resources for the users. As it is released under General Public Licence (GPL), it becomes legal for anyone to edit it.

  **Differentiate between LINUX and UNIX?**
 
  Answer:
  | Linux | Unix |
  |-------|------|
  |LINUX is an open source software development and free operating system used for computer hardware & software, game development, PCs, etc | UNIX is an operating system which is basically used in Intel, HP, internet servers, etc|
  | LINUX has priced as well as freely distributed and downloaded versions | Different versions/flavours of UNIX have different price structures |
  | Users of this operating system could be anyone including home users, developers, etc | This operating system was basically developed for mainframes, servers and workstations except for OSX which is designed such that it can be used by anyone |
  | File support system includes Ext2, Ext3, Ext4, Jfs, Xfs, Btrfs, FAT, etc | File support system includes jfs, gpfs, hfs, etc |
  BASH (Bourne Again Shell) is the Linux default shell i.e. text mode interface which supports multiple command interpreters | Bourne shell serves as the text mode interface which is now compatible with many others including BASH |
  LINUX provides two GUIs, KDE and Gnome | Common desktop environment was created which serves as a GUI for UNIX|
  Examples: Red Hat, Fedora, Ubuntu, Debian, etc | Examples: Solaris, All Linux
  t provides higher security and has about 60-100 viruses listed till date |It is also highly secured and has about 85-120 viruses listed till date |



  **Enlist the basic components of LINUX?**
  Answer: Linux operating system basically consists of 3 components. They are:
  
  **Kernel:** This is considered as the core part and is responsible for all major activities of the Linux operating system. Linux Kernel is considered as free and open-source software that is capable of managing hardware resources for the users. It consists of various modules and interacts directly with the underlying hardware.
  **System Library:** Most of the functionalities of the operating system are implemented by System Libraries. These act as a special function using which application programs accesses Kernel’s features.
  **System Utility:** These programs are responsible for performing specialized, individual-level tasks.
